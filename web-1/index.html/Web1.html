    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <p>
        The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief
        and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data.
    </p>
    <p>
        This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks
        of data, as simplification usually does.
    </p>
    <p>
        Clarity regers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is 
        often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.
